# Numbers Station Embeddable Widget

## Development

This is a `create-react-app`. You can build it like so:

- Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- (Optional) For developing, start app on localhost

```bash
npm run start
```

- Run build command

```bash
npm run build
```

- The build files should now be in `build` folder, ready to be deployed and served. This includes
  - `index.html` The entry point for the react app
  - `loader.js` The script that is used to load the react widget in the target website
